You Cant Always Get What You Want Chords by The Rolling Stones
Difficulty: intermediate
Tuning: E B E G# B E


YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT
(Jagger-Richards) 
Original studio recording:
Rolling Stones, "Let It Bleed" album (London Records, 1969)
(also on a single, edited - minus 2nd verse, 3rd verse cut in half) 

Main rhythm guitar: acoustic in OPEN E TUNING, CAPO 8!
(Once you figure that out the rest isn't too hard) 
tempo: medium ballad - about 104 b.p.m. 

E tuning, low to high:  E, B, E, G#, B, E 

Chords:                     () = chord with capo            
            E  B  E  G# B  E
Eadd9       0  0  2  0  0  0     (Cadd9)  (or call it "add 2"?)
A           0  2  0  1  2  0     (F)
F#          2  2  2  2  2  2     (D)

E |-0--------|-0--------|---------|---------|---------|
B |-0--------|-2--------|---------|---------|---------|
E |-0--------|-0--------|---------|---------|---------|   

(Note: unwilling to tune up to open E? Tuning to open D instead? You'll
find this hard to play (capo 10) unless you've got a cut-away.
I suggest tuning to open E-flat instead (1/2 step/one fret down from E,
1 up from D) it doesn't put undue strain on the neck and you won't break
the G string - it stays G. The you can capo 9 and get to open C, or if that's
still hard to finger, capo to 8 and play it in B)

This song is built around the following 2 bar lick:

  pull-off                                                  hammer-on 

This pattern repeats throughout the song
with slight (mostly rhythmic) variations - listen to recording for rhythm.

Full structure: lyrics, chords--in capoed tone, measures (|)  

(Opening: choir sings 1st verse, chorus) 
Cadd9 | F  x4, with French horn intro.  

[Verse 1]
  | Cadd9                    | F
I saw her today at the reception,
| Cadd9                     | F
a glass of wine in her hand
  | Cadd9                         | F
I knew she was gonna meet her connection,
       | Cadd9                 | F
at her feet was a footloose man  

[Chorus]
     | Cadd9                    | F
You can't always get what you wa-ant       x3
           | D  (see fill #1 below) | F                    | C    | F
but if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need  

[Verse 2] 
I went down to the demonstration, to get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "we're gonna vent our frustration,if we don't we're gonna blow a 50 amp fuse"  

[Chorus]  

[Verse 3] (add 4 extra Cadd9 , F's - twice as long) 
I went down to the Chelsea Drug Store, to get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy, and man did he look pretty ill
We decided we would have a soda, my favorite flavor--cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy,and he said one word to me and that was "dead" 

I said to him...  

[Chorus]  

[Interlude]
with brief electric solo and choir 

Dsus| C | F | Dsus| G7sus|
then an instrumental chorus with last line sung 

(If you don't have a choir handy - I seem to have misplaced mine right at the
moment - or a lead guitarist, try changing the rhythm to rapid strumming)  

[Verse 4] (back to standard pattern/rhythm) 
I saw her today at the reception, in her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception,I could tell by her bloodstained hands  

[Chorus]
3 times, then repeat and fade on Cadd9 , F with choir
